              <p>
                Full Stack Development refers to the practice of building web
                applications that involve both the front-end (client-side) and
                back-end (server-side) portions of the application. A Full Stack
                Developer is someone who possesses skills and expertise in
                working with both the front-end and back-end technologies,
                allowing them to contribute to the entire development process.
